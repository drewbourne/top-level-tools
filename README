Top-Level Tools is a collection of package-level functions to make your ActionScript 3 life easier.

Package-level functions are slightly faster than static function calls and more convenient from your IDE as they're available anywhere with auto-complete. I initially considered building runnable classes with interfaces for each of these functions for best "out-of-the-box" performance, but decided it's just best for you to copy/paste these functions inline if you're seeking the best possible performance from these. (Considering starting an MXMLC ticket for supporting inlining to solve this problem completely)


A large part of the project is focusing on gathering utils from other open-source projects around the web. The list below deserves the proper credit for writing these great utils:
http://casalib.org/ (the majority of the tools come from casalib)
http://jacksondunstan.com/
http://blog.soulwire.co.uk/
http://www.flightxd.com/flightframework/
http://destroytoday.com
http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/
more to come...


TODO: 

1. Get community support
2. Gather util functions from around the web (always giving credit!)
3. Fully unit test each tool
4. Move tools that require behind-the-scenes mapping into a separate, more meaningful package. "maps?"
5. Optimize! Optimize! Optimize! Optimize! Optimize!
